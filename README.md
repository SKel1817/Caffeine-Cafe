# Caffeine Cafe
Final project for CSI 1310, Welcome to Caffeine Cafe where all of your coffee dreams are lines of text on a screen.

### Descripton: 
For my project, I created a script that simulates being in a coffee shop. It could be used as a complicated online ordering system, which can be useful to a coffee shop that only does pick-up or online orders. It could also be a useful starting point for an immersive café style game. So, the uses are endless for this script.  My script can do 4 different things, List the menu, order a coffee, suggest a coffee, and view customer history, technically 5 if you count leaving. I think this is useful because not only could you use this to do online orders, but you could use it yourself to keep track of what coffees you have ordered in the past so it’s easier to re-order them. It could also be useful to keep track of coffee suggestions, most coffee shops do a featured coffee so if you are constantly getting suggestions with ingredients it will make, making a new coffee that much easier. This program uses one main class system and some if/elif/else statements to make it work for maneuverability.
